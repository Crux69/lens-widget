# lens-widget

The lens widget is a draggable window within a web app that is used to display other map services on top of an existing map service. [Demo:  Lens Widget](http://swingley.github.com/lens-widget/)

ArcMap has overview/magnifier windows and there are similar tools available for Esri's other web APIs (flex and silverlight). [Cartifact Maps also has a cool lens widget on their site](http://maps.cartifact.com/lany/). Finally, there's also a lens type tool in the examples that are bundled with PolyMaps. This widget provides similar functionality for the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

The widget is created from a page that includes an ArcGIS API for JavaScript map. The widget takes two arguments:
-a map (this is the base map sits under the lens)
-an array of objects that contain information about each map service to be displayed in the lens 

When the widget's init method is called, the widget loops through the array of map services and creates layers out of them. The widget also builds a filtering select to let a user select which map service should be displayed in the lens window. The final component of the lens window is a horizontal slider that lets you control the transparency of the layer being displayed in the lens window.

The lens widget works with both tiled and dynamic map services. For performance reasons, tiled services are preferred.

## TODO

* move template string to separate .html file
* use data-dojo-attach-point in template and get rid of dijit.byId calls
* convert to AMD
* check that the lens map service SR matches the map's SR
* check for map.loaded within the widget so it's not necessary to connect map.onLoad to use the widget
